# Threat-Informed-Defense-Ecosystem
Backup of the TID Ecosystem hosted on Start[.]me at https://start.me/p/X25q7l/threat-informed-defense-ecosystem

The Threat-Informed Defense Ecosystem is a collection of resources, products, strategies, educational tips, and guides for applying a threat-informed cyber defense strategy. I want to help develop practitioners who understand how to apply practices and techniques of TID. My goal is to provide everything one needs to become a TID specialist, from 0 to 90ish, without an overwhelming amount of resources/lists/links.
